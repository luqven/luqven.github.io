I have 16GB of memory. Anything above 30% at idle should be an anomaly. Thereâ€™s no reason for <code class=\"language-text\">vmmemm</code> to be taking up a whopping 10% of my available memory at idle. Or at least, I donâ€™t there should be.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, <a href=\"https://simonpeterdebbarma.com/\">Simon Peter Debbarma</a> outlines <a href=\"https://blog.simonpeterdebbarma.com/2020-04-memory-and-wsl/\">a way</a> to limit the amount of RAM that the WSL distro can access at any given time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use <code class=\"language-text\">wsl -l -v</code> to check out all running distros on your WSL. Then, <code class=\"language-text\">wsl -t {insert distro}</code> to terminate the ones in use. Or, simply <code class=\"language-text\">wsl --shutdown</code>. <a href=\"https://blog.simonpeterdebbarma.com/2020-04-memory-and-wsl/\">ðŸ”—</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The tradeoff in performance by limiting the amount of RAM WSl can access is obvious. It doesnâ€™t seem like WSL should be this inefficient, but maybe Iâ€™m splitting hairs here. Ubuntu inside windows does seem like its <em>still</em> too good to be true doesnâ€™t it?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"WSL2 is a memory hog and how to fix it.","date":"September 25, 2020","description":"Simon Debbarma teaches us how to take back memory from Vmmem"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/wsl2-is-a-memory-hog/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/windows-javascropt-development-with-wsl/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Javascript development on windows with WSL"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/request-animation-frame-versus-request-idle-callback/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Best practices for requestIdleCallback and requestAnimationFrame in 2021"}}}}}
