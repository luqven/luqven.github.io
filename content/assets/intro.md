description: A little about me
---

I love designing and programming user experiences. I went into software development because of the fieldâ€™s combination of problem solving and design.

I most recently helped the team at Parsec Media optimize and develop the Adelaide client-side javascript libraries which monitor a user's attention to ad units for hundreds of thousands of sessions a day.

I graduated with dual-degree in Technical Writing & History from Carnegie Mellon University, after which I worked at an online publisher for 2 years.
