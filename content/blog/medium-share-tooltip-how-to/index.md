> We've previously covered how to [create a useSelection hook that stores the currently selected text]() and [Styling selected text with CSS]() in this series. If you haven't taken a look, I recommend you do so now as we'll be  off of those blog posts.

For part 3 of this **Browser Selection API** series, we're going to build our own [Medium-like](https://dribbble.com/shots/1330226-Medium-Style-Tooltip) sharing tooltip. The idea is to have a simple Twitter, Email, and generic "other" sharing tooltip appear whenever text is selected on the page.

For an idea of the finished product, go ahead and select some text on this post or look at the example bellow.
