        <p>I’m a software developer with extensive experience in React, Redux, Rails, Javascript, and Ruby. I went into software
        development because I loved the field’s combination of problem solving and design.
        </p>

        <p>
          After I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a degree in Technical Writing, I worked at an online publisher
          for 2 years as an editor,.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I managed a staff of 26 people and answered to millions of readers. But I found that I spent more and more of my time
          fixing problems with the site than I did actually editing or writing articles, and that I really enjoyed doing it. That
          exposure motivated me to make a career change to software development.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          That’s why I went to App Academy. The program was extremely challenging and fast paced, but ultimately rewarding. I got
          to build great projects there like a YouTube clone and a web animations-teaching site.
